# Frame of Reference:  Umuzi Tech
# Web Development Program Outline

## Month -1: Online Learning and Bootcamp
During the application process, we ask prospective recruits to learn basic HTML and CSS skills through free online platforms (currently FreeCodeCamp and Khan Academy). In the screening process, they also complete several tests which evaluate their personality, numeracy, statistical understanding, and logical thinking. Those who perform well on these platforms are invited for an interview, and a selection of interviewees are invited bootcamp.


During a two-week bootcamp, the final stage of of Umuzi’s selection process, the applicants continue with online learning through FreeCodeCamp and are given a series of challenges. There are two short web development challenges they complete in their first week. In the second week, they start learning JavaScript and are given 5 simple challenges, as well as a more difficult problem (we don’t expect them to solve the difficult problem, we only ask them to walk us through their approach for trying to solve it). In addition to these technical challenges, we also have a series of group games and challenges to learn how they work with a team and under pressure. If the applicant performs well during bootcamp, they are invited to join Umuzi as a recruit.


## Month 0: #MakeUmuziBetter
A recruit’s journey starts with a three-week programme called Make Umuzi Better. Recruits from all departments form small cross-functional teams to tackle issues at Umuzi--anything from mental health to kitchen norms to the physical layout of our space. To accomplish this, they learn about and execute Human-Centered Design, a technique used throughout their time at Umuzi. Each team maps out user journeys, conducts interviews and surveys, designs a prototype of their solution, and presents it to the staff and external guests.
Months 1-4: Game Development Curriculum
The first few months for a Umuzi Web Dev recruit are dedicated to obtaining a National Certificate of Information Technology: Systems Development (Level 5).


During this time they are spending the first hour of each day going through lessons of FreeCodeCamp (primarily increasing their JavaScript knowledge).
