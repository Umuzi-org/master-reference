Umuzi is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for 
everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, 
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, 
ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not 
tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Sexual language, 
imagery or innuendo is not appropriate for any community event, 
including talks, workshops, parties, Slack, Twitter and other online 
media or channels. 

Office hours are 9am - 5pm. You are expected to be at Umuzi, on time for 
9am stand-up sessions, during these times. A doctor's note may be 
required if you are not in the office during regular working hours. 
Please notify the department on the WhatsApp group if you are going to 
be late.
