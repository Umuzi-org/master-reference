## Data Assignment:

Write a script called `factorial.py` that takes a number and returns its factorial.

## Steps:
- Think about which tests you want to do to test that the factorial function works.
- Write the tests **first** (before creating the function).
- Test an empty function called factorial - it should fail the tests
- Add code for returning the factorial of a number - it should pass for numbers >= 1
- Add code for dealing with zero - should pass unit test for zero and for numbers >= 1
- Add code for dealing with negative numbers
- Add code for dealing with non-numeric input

Once you are done, upload your tests and function to Github.
