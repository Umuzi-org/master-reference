## Introduction
K-Means clustering is used in a variety of applications such as market segmentation, document clustering, image segmentation and image compression. Usually we do K-Means clustering to:

Understand the structure of the data
Cluster the data into subgroups and then do different predictions on the different subgroups.
If we think that subgroup behaviours differ substantially, then it will get more accurate models by making separate models for each subgroup, than one model for all groups.

## Assignments
### Easy clustering assignment: Flower features
Data: [Iris species](https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimechlearn/classification-with-iris-dataset/data)

1. Use K-Means cluster analysis to cluster different iris species. Make an elbow plot and/or use silhouette analayis to find the optimal number of clusters.

2. What are the factors that differ between different iris species?

3. Create a plot of the clusters.

### Optional: Whiskey clusters
Data: [Whiskey Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/koki25ando/cluster-analysis-of-whisky-reviews-using-k-means/data)

Cluster whiskey types by reviewers' scores. Use the elbow or silhouette method to find the optimal number of clusters. Describe the main differences between the cluster - what are the factors that differ between differently rated whiskey clusters?
