## Required reading
- [Ethical checklist for data science](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/2015/09/18/an-ethical-checklist-for-data-science/)
-- Key questions that data scientists should ask as they pursue their projects, including questions about appropriate project selection, biases and privacy concerns in data collection, concerns about transparency and discrimination in analysis, and the limitations of any findings being appropriately communicated.
- [Five Principles of Ethical Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/5-principles-for-big-data-ethics-b5df1d105cd3)
-- The scale and ease with which we can analyse user data has completely changed our ethical framework. Because existing ethical and legal frameworks cannot keep up with the changes in data science, it is important to follow principles that respect user privacy, allow users to control how their data is shared, and not allow our models to introduce or further systemic biases like racism or sexism.
- [Data Science Association Code of Conduct](http://www.datascienceassn.org/code-of-conduct.html)
-- A useful list of terminology related to data science and rules for how a data scientist should conduct a professional relationship with clients.
